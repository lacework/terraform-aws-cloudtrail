# Integrate Existing CloudTrail with Lacework Using Existing SNS Topic

This example integrates an existing CloudTrail with Lacework and uses an existing SNS topic already configured for the trail.

**IMPORTANT: This example assumes that your CloudTrail is already sending delivery notifications
to the provided SNS topic. If the existing CloudTrail does NOT have SNS notification enabled,
look at the example named [existing-cloudtrail-without-sns-topic](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/lacework/cloudtrail/aws/latest/examples/existing-cloudtrail-without-sns-topic)**
